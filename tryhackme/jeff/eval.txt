This room was quite fun. It was listed as "hard" so I was a little bit worried
if I would get anything out of it. The fact that you had to break out of a docker
container was interesting.

I did have to look up a few things in a walkthrough to get a hint of how to
continue:

1. To enumerate file-names, which is something I could have thought of myself.

2. Enumerating the fact that I had to specify vhost when enumerating sub-domains.

3. The exact function to use when creating a wordpress-reverse shell, but not the
fact that I could use the plugins to create it.

4. The idea that "tar *" was used on the host machine.

5. To symlink the message.txt to jeff.bak
