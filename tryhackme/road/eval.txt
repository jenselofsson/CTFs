This challenge was quite fun. Since it was based on a real-world pentest, it
didn't have a set path which a lot of CTFs have.

I also manage to solve it pretty much by myself, except for realizing that
the "Submit" button on the profile page could be used by admin@sky.thm. Once
I got that hint, I got it pretty much on my own. And I feel like I could've gotten
that by myself, given more patience. On the other steps I had patience, which
paid off. It will be fun to look up other ways of passing the challenge.

Lessons to take from this:
* Use multiple wordlists when scanning for directories.
* While manually looking around for privsec possibilities is fun, it might be
  faster to run linpeas. It can stop me from going down the wrong rabbit hole
  and save some time. I did spent 5 minutes looking into if I could connect to
  the mysql-server.
* Learn how to cross-compile between archs. If I'm on another arch than the
  target, compiling exploits etc will be useful.
