All in all, I did fairly well on this.

The parts where I needed to consult a walkthrough were:
1. To decode the vigenere ciphered poem in the beginning.

2. To realize that the last "hash" in humptydumpty.txt was a hex string, not a
sha256 hash.

3. To get the idea to look at /home/alice a bit closer.

4. To realize that I could cat /etc/sudoers.d/alice instead of running sudo -l

5. To find out that I could use sudo -h to specify the host.

I did "struggle" a bit with getting a more stable shell, so that is something I
need to look more into. Although I knew what I wanted to do, I still needed
to look up how to do it.

But I did manage to do it without consulting a walkthrough.
